Cleans – Crystal clear, clean water
Protects – Gentle on the skin, safe for the environment
Enjoy – Less time maintaining your water, more time to enjoy it!
  The patented technology behind AquaFinesse has proven to be revolutionary and years ahead of its time as it demonstrates consistent outstanding results.
The Special Water team have succeeded in addressing the real cause of bacterial pollution by developing a range of products to mitigate biofilm in an environmentally friendly way, which until now was only achievable by using the harshest of chemicals, with their well documented disadvantages such as toxic action to the environment and corrosion causing properties.
AquaFinesse products are not biocides and do not contain complicated organic compounds. They work simply by loosening the biofilm (slimy layers) from their substrate, to keep your pool, swim spa or hot tub clean and crystal clear.
Our products are so gentle that tests carried out on AquaFinesse  show no toxic effect on macro fauna or fish.
AquaFinesse offers you environmentally friendly water care solutions that work.
Sit back, relax and enjoy the water treatment products of AquaFinesse!"

HeatForm has transformed the swimming pool construction process, whilst the added value of insulation keeps expensive heating bills to a minimum, helping to reduce the amount of energy required to keep pools at a comfortable temperature.
Not only does this reduce the amount of energy being wasted through heat loss, but also helps the environment by using empty plastic (PET) bottles to form the insulated section of the pool wall. 
MagnaPool® is an exclusive chlorinator solution that combines the natural properties of the patented magnesium-based MagnaPool minerals with an exceptionally fine filtration system, providing water without any chlorine smell or any eye or skin irritation. 
Zodiac Electric robotic cleaners are precise. Whatever the shape and dimensions of the pool, Zodiac robots reach every corner, climb the walls and clean the water line. These robotic cleaners are truly all-terrain: they adapt to all kinds of surfaces, perfectly grip the walls and get over obstacles easily. "

With persistence and determination, he persuaded more and more people of his vision.  In every sense, he was a pioneering environmentalist.
