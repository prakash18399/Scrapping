Abbeyhorn (Established 1749),https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/abbeyhorn-established-1749,www.abbeyhorn.co.uk,"Kendal, United Kingdom","Welcome to the world of Abbeyhorn, please come and visit our stand DP1-C48 to see the amazing things we can produce from Horn. We are the last remaining horn works of our size in the UK, and we can trace our roots back to the 17th Century when the art of horn carving was prolific. Today’s Artisans still use these traditional skills, handed down over generations, to produce a unique range of natural and appealing gifts. Paul, Abbeyhorn's owner, started as an apprentice Horn Carver back in 1980, he loved the company so much that he bought it in 1991 and moved us from Kendal, to the little village of Holme on the cusp of the Lake District. We have 9 Horn crafts people in our on-site factory, 1 member of staff in the packing room, 2 ladies in the Office and Paul the Owner/Director. Abbeyhorn is very proud to source our raw materials from ethical sources. The Ankole Cow Horn is a by-product of the meat industry in Nigeria, and our Antler comes from a herd of Red Deer in Scotland which is collected by hand when they shed them between April and June. These horns would just be discarded, so instead we hand make them into beautiful individual gifts and homeware. No two pieces of horn are ever the same in colouration or size, so every piece we produce is unique. Over the years Abbeyhorn has produced props for several films and TV programs and are very proud to be the official manufacturer of the Horn mugs seen on the cult series “Game Of Thrones”, and the horn cups for “Vikings”. “How it’s made” recently filmed in our factory and this will go live at the end of April. Abbeyhorn has an extensive range from the traditional to the unusual and are always looking for new ideas to extend the collection. This year we would like to showcase our New Oak Shoe Brushes, Cashmere Brush and Horn Drinks Stirrers, along side our extensive Male Grooming Range and our traditional Shoehorn’s. So please pop along to meet Paul, Tracey and Marianne and discover our stunning range of unique gifts."

Black Sheep Creations,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/black-sheep-creations,www.blacksheepcandles.co.uk,"Dukinfield, United Kingdom","ABOUT US Black Sheep Creations began in 2016. My Name Is Joanna and I have a passion for beautifully smelling candles but after being disappointed in the candles on the market to date, I started experimenting with fragrances and wax. I began to realise that the secret to great candles were; beautiful fragrance, a natural wax and a clean burn. Nothing beats the feeling of knowing my customers love my candles just as much as I do, and it’s why I spend so much time and effort perfecting them. All our candles, and reed diffusers are individually hand-poured and finished in my cosy workshop using 100% natural soy wax, cotton wicks and gorgeous fragrances. I chose to work with a natural Soy Wax as this is a natural renewable resource that allows for a cleaner burn, without the emission of toxin, unlike paraffin wax used by many other candle makers, soy wax blends better with all our scents resulting in a clean and longer lasting burn time. Our Style is very sleek and Modern, focusing on two main colours ""Black & White"" for all oue Jars and Boxes. Co found – Jo Matthews"

No trace was ever found of his seemingly doomed expedition... until that is, in 1997, an old battered trunk purchased at a house clearance sale, was taken home and its locks forced. Incredibly, amongst its decaying and mildewed contents was found an exquisite dressing case containing salves, unguents, ointments and the missing adventurers long lost journals. Scattered amongst the many tales of hardship, derring do and wonders seen, where one was expected to “keep a stiff upper lip, regardless”, were found meticulously detailed lists of exotic ingredients for use in the Captain’s very own grooming requisites. These precise formulae have been faithfully followed and Fawcett’s original potions, along with his world renowned Moustache Wax are now available to the discerning gentleman for the first time in over a century."

Daisycat,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/daisycat,www.daisycat.co.uk,"Nottingham, United Kingdom","Daisycat cards are printed and hand finished at my home studio in Nottingham, UK. Daisycat was born out of a lifelong love of cards and the tradition of sending them. For me, a carefully chosen card arriving in the post with a handwritten message from a loved one, really makes my day. I tend to keep my most favourite cards and messages rather than throw them away and with this sentiment in mind many of the cards come with a little something to keep long after the ocassion. The most popular range comes with decorative wooden keepsakes which can be used as keyrings, gift tags, or hung on the Christmas tree. Chidren may even like to paint or decorate the shapes. Other card ranges come with seeds to sow or wooden magnets I take inspiration from pattern, colour, vintage, retro and nature, and also from my daughter Daisy and her wonderful imagination, her love of animals, birds, flowers, polka dots, buttons and googly eyes. I hope you enjoy our work and it makes you smile"

At the age of 21 I started experimenting and creating strong; true to life scents with the unique ability to transport you back in time, triggering heart-warming memories and emotions. Initially I started with 7 scents and boiling pots of wax in Mums’ kitchen. The weekends were then spent attending local handmade artisan markets. Within 12 months I had successfully created and launched a range of wax melts in over 100 scrumptious scents. I would have never believed three years on Mum would be working along side me, in our own premises! Still to this day, all products are hand crafted in small batches, made with oodles of care and attention within the heart of Cheshire. As a brand we are proud to announce all of our wax melts are vegan friendly, offering a home fragrance solution to an even wider audience. Our melts are an alternative way to fragrance your home, allowing customers the opportunity to switch up their scents at a moments notice. We feel we can offer a new and exciting product to the market, giving customers an affordable, fun and exciting experience, which does not compromise on either luxury or quality. All of our products are highly scented using the finest of ingredients. We have even improved our packaging to make sure our pots are made using 100% recycled raw material which then can go onto being 100% recycled, we’ve even added a euro tab for ease of display. We’ve since expanded our range which now includes, room sprays, diffuser oils, candles, bath bombs, reed diffusers and our latest product soap sponges."

Supplying the Toy and Gift trade for over thirty years, Funtime Gifts helps recreate distant memories at the same time as inventing future ones. It’s huge array of novelty gifts and toys provide something for everyone. Founder Malcolm Ford, first ventured into the puzzle and gift market while studying civil engineering at Loughborough University in 1969 and with two other engineers, formulated a range of complex 3D puzzles to test the brain, hand and eye coordination. These were launched for the first time in 1972 and led to the foundation of Funtime Gifts. Funtime is probably best revered for bringing the Disco Dancing Flowers and the singing fish – Big Mouth Billy Bass (still singing and back by popular demand after 17 years) – to these shores. Nowadays in the world of iPhones and iPads, electronics and synchronisation in toys are taken totally for granted; back then it was unseen and was quite groundbreaking. Today Funtime is still breaking the mould with guns that fire air, animals that laugh, a mini arcade machine, lasers that turn your ceiling into a planetarium, the best-selling world’s smallest range and so much more… Many items continue to stand the test of time, Pin Art and Newton’s cradle to the classic Metal Spud Gun have been in and out of the range for the last thirty years and will surely continue for many more to come. In 2016 Funtime were appointed exclusive distributors of Spencer and Fleetwood. This is slightly risque naugty fun and cheeky range of products and edibles is best described as Adult Gifts for Childish minds. Perhaps originally best known for Chocolate Body Paint and Edible Underwear and nowadays for more recent introductions of uproarious Jizz Game to Karma Sutra Jellies!

Order via the phone, email or the website or one of our regional agents, whichever is easiest for you. The offices are open 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday.

The story so far... I have been designing greetings cards for my entire working career, and it has become my lifelong passion. Having previously worked with major publishers on many varied projects, I have gained an insight into the whole greetings card industry, and I felt that the time was right to take the next exciting step into publishing my own work... and 'Ginger Betty' was born. All of my designs are hand-painted and are inspired by my love of nature. I’m hoping to capture a sentiment and a personal touch to engage directly with customers. A family affair... The company is a joint venture between myself and my husband Pete - who's great on the mac! and makes the 'mac-magic' happen - formatting and setting the designs up for print, and dropping on those important finishing touches... we are a great team, and just love working together! Where did the name come from? you may ask... Well it's simple really... when our daughter was just two years old she was given a small rag doll with woolly ginger hair, which she hugged and loved, and took absolutely everywhere with her - she called this liitle doll 'Ginger Betty' ... so when our daughter left home for university - 'Ginger Betty' just seemed to be the perfect name choice for our publishing venture!"

The setting, surrounded by beautiful gardens, beaches, horses, wildlife and countryside is a strong influence on our style, but their backgrounds in the fashion world and a love of travel also shine through. Caroline, who trained in Textile Design prior to Silversmithing at Leeds University, designs most of the pieces herself, and Heath’s background in retail and fashion means he knows just what both retailers and consumers are going to love. As design is at the heart of what we do, quality and detail are hugely important, and we are personally involved in every step of the manufacturing process. We are still essentially a family-run business, but with some major corporate customers, many commissioning their own ranges, and many wonderful independent stockists from the southern tip of Cornwall to the Orkneys. We have big ambitions, and we hope to see Reeves & Reeves bringing a touch of style to your parties, holidays, special events or just everyday days for generations to come. Quality is crucial to us. All our silver is Assay Assured, and hall-marked when required, and all our gold is 18 carat gold vermeil (18 carat gold over sterling silver).

At the Home County Candle Co. we hand-pour our range of beautifully scented soy candles and reed diffusers from our workshop in Hertfordshire. OUR INSPIRATION We feel that each of the counties that we have lived in, worked in and had the pleasure of visiting has its own unique character. We have therefore drawn upon our experiences and memories to create our unique scents, each inspired by the county it is named after. OUR MISSION At the Home County Candle Co. we are passionate about the abundance of outstanding natural beauty surrounding our home and workshop, which is why we are committed to producing sustainable products with minimal impact on the environment. Our candles are produced from natural soy wax, which is biodegradable, and vegan friendly. Our sustainable wooden crackle wicks also not only look great but burn more slowly with a cleaner burn and more flame time. It is important to us to support as many local businesses as we can whilst manufacturing our candles. We therefore take great care to select suppliers from within the UK, and more specifically the Home Counties wherever possible. ""TO CREATE BEAUTIFUL, SUSTAINABLE HAND CRAFTED PRODUCTS WHICH PERFECTLY REPRESENT THE ESSENCE OF THE HOME COUNTIES"""

Inside Out Toys Ltd,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/inside-out-toys-ltd,www.insideouttoys.co.uk,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","Julian and I ‘joined forces’ in 2012 and Inside Out Toys Ltd was borne out of a desire to create something which would keep us both busy up until retirement age. Both of us had come from corporate backgrounds and the lure of working for ourselves was strong! The company was originally established in a small industrial unit just outside Derby – Julian’s hometown – and it moved to Milton Keynes in 2016 when we bought our family home in Silverstone. Between us, we have 6 children – 4 of whom are all grown up, and 2 still living at home – so we know only too well the sort of toys children love to play with and those that parents love to have in their homes! We have a small dedicated team at our premises in Milton Keynes and have always prided ourselves in being a family-friendly employer – taking our responsibilities seriously in terms of offering flexible working and looking after our employees. We also recognise that we have a social responsibility as a business and try to support as many charities as we can every year – through donations to Northamptonshire Health Charity and Giving World amongst others. Our product ranges are constantly evolving – influenced by feedback from a growing army of loyal trade customers. We recognise the desire for sustainable toys, produced by ethically and socially responsible manufacturers and the brands we offer reflect those values. Jumini, our own brand of brightly coloured wooden toys, was launched in 2016 and this was followed in 2019 by the Studio Circus collection of pastel coloured wooden toys, which are designed in the Netherlands. We have been actively looking for other brands of environmentally friendly toys to add to our portfolio and came across the award-winning Tikiri brand of natural rubber and organic cotton toys at Spring Fair 2020. So, we are immensely proud to have been chosen to represent this brand in the United Kingdom. More recently we finalised an agreement to become the UK distributor for Viking Toys and their Ecoline of environmentally friendly 'plastic' toys, made from sugar cane! We hope you will love what we have to offer as much as we do and cannot wait to supply you with some toys for your store! Julian & Nikki Garner Inside Out Toys Ltd Trade Website"

The translucency of fine porcelain is complimented by the flickering reflections of candle light. All our candles come with silver colour or porcelain lids to keep the candles clean when not in use. A luxurious gift box completes the gift. There are four distinct stories in the range: –:Blue Floral Lantern: The porcelain is decorated with a floral pattern to complement the botanical fragrances. The vessel can later be used as a tealight lantern. – Blue Peacock Set: A modern twist to a traditional botanical pattern, with a beautifully shaped porcelain diffuser and candle set – White Porcelain Candles: This is a simple classic, with a pure white porcelain vessel and silver lid. – Botanic : Fragranced candles, hand poured into beautiful bone china vessels with real gold and embossment floral pattern.

Leather Guild,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/leather-guild,www.leatherguild.co.uk,United Kingdom,"It’s full on at Leather Guild since being awarded Gift of the Year 2019 for our “Fetch This” canine collection for dapper dogs. After seeing the success we enjoyed with our unique designs of leather and pure Scottish wool tweed, for men and women, we looked at the pets sector and came up with collars, leads and bow ties for dogs. As this requires the skills of a saddler we developed the collars and leads in conjunction with our jeans belt range and in turn added saddlery to the Guild of crafts and skills that make up Leather Guild. The tweeds used in our products are our unique designs so only Leather Guild products will feature these tweeds. They are woven in the Islay Woollen Mill where they have been weaving wool since the early 1800s. Their looms produce a very tight weave which is both tough and durable. At the finishing stage we apply DuPont Teflon coating for improved stain and moisture resistance. Practical and more importantly - beautiful - to use and own. The unique range of engraved wallets for men, featuring over 30 designs, was Highly Commended in Gift of the Year 2018 and have enjoyed considerable success. Our ranges include bags, purses, wallets, belts, collars, leads and gloves in both leather and leather/ tweed combos. Our unique tweed is also made into ties and bow ties for both four legged and two legged creatures. Look out for our “walk the dog” bags and the new backpacks."

Lime Tree Design,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/lime-tree-design,www.limetreecollection.com,"Nottingham, United Kingdom","Lime Tree Design started out as a kitchen table business back in 2008 when a move from London to a rural Nottinghamshire village with small children opened up new possibilities. It quickly grew from strength to strength driven by my love of vintage jewellery (particularly lockets), pattern colour and above all original and interesting design, having had 15 years experience in the gift and design business. Our collection developed further when joined by designer Julia Wright who brought with her technical expertise and a passion for sculpture, which you can see in our charm range. We still work with a small team in a studio at the end of the garden and are supported by the craftsmen in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter amongst others. Our jewellery designs are all created by us using traditional methods and then made in sterling silver, gold vermeil and rose-gold vermeil. We also make a small range in solid gold and can create bespoke pieces if needed. We have recently started working with an artisan workshop in Jaipur who hand block prints cotton fabrics in our designs. This year sees the launch of our textile collection which includes Hankies, Bandanas, Kimonos, Face Masks, and Tunics and Lounge wear coming later in the year. Along side our own textiles we have always worked with Liberty Tana Lawn to make our range of Lavender Sardines and Lavender Birds.

Our product ranges offer an exceptional choice of developmental activity toys, innovative rocking horses, ride ons and push alongs. Toys to fire the imagination In an industry awash with electronic toys we see the beauty in simple traditionally based toys, that have the ability to capture a child's imagination and encourage explorative play. That's why all of our products have carefully considered interactive features that stimulate and encourage free play, rather than dictate it. Thinking about our children's children Where we can, we use materials that can be easily recycled or are biodegradable. That's why we have a 'low tech' approach and focus our efforts on offering products without battery powered functions. We make every effort to minimise the use of plastic packaging or plastic bags, favouring biodegradable cardboard and tissue paper. So where we can make a difference, we will. Everyone's happy! We're confident that we've created a range of toys that delight and stimulate children as well as providing exceptional quality and longevity. So in the end it's not just the little people who will be happy, but the grown ups too! Built to last Toys today seem to last only as long as a child's attention span before they break or wear out! We believe in toys that are built to last. That's why our toys are made to the highest quality. Not just for a few hours, but for years of fun! Designed in Yorkshire! We always work hard to make our toys distinctive. Our animal ride ons and all of our rocking horses are design registered to make sure our creativity is protected."

Lucy Flint Jewellery,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/lucy-flint-jewellery,www.lucyflintjewellery.co.uk,United Kingdom,"Hi, I’m Lucy. Since I was tiny, I have always had a love for flowers and making things; as I grew older this developed into a real fondness for nature-inspired design in all forms. Jewellery making and metalwork as a medium, for me, started out as a hobby. I took some time out from my day-job to study a course at The London Jewellery School - just for fun - not realising that it would lead me to where I am today. This silversmithing course sparked my passion for making intricate designs, taking elements from wild and natural things. Once it was over, I realised this was something I really wanted to continue with, so, I bought all the tools, got set up in my spare room and started practising and developing on the techniques I had learned. Since then, I have attended many other courses covering all aspects of jewellery making, from casting to polishing and stone setting. Lucy Flint Jewellery was officially set up in 2014 when my Husband and I moved away from our ‘normal’ jobs in London and decided to make the leap into jewellery making full time. Our first jewellery boutique and workshop was in the town of Melton Mowbray but we soon outgrew this little shop and moved to the pretty town of Oakham, into a bigger and brighter character-filled space. Every piece of Lucy Flint Jewellery is handmade using traditional silversmithing techniques. It’s such a pleasure to deal directly with lovely customers in my boutique and I find it so rewarding making jewellery to treasure, that is full of meaning and helps to cherish special people, places and events in life that really matter."

Natural Partners Limited,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/natural-partners-limited,www.naturalpartnersart.co.uk,"Redcar, United Kingdom","Natural Partners Limited is a family-run business established by Joe and Karen Cole. Based in Marske-by-Sea on the beautiful North Yorkshire coast, we have been publishing fine art greeting cards and prints since 2010. Joe grew up in a very artistic family - his mother was a secondary school art teacher while his late father, also called Joe, was a celebrated Senior Lecturer at Cleveland College of Art & Design who launched many successful art careers and who after his death became recognised as a leading British artist of his time. Despite this and an aunt and uncle who were artists, along with two cousins who have also forged successful art careers, Joe trained as a zoologist and had a long career in UK nature conservation charities. He thought he'd escaped from the art world, but it's steadily pulling him back to his roots! Having heard many tales of artists being poorly treated by agencies, we have been determined from the outset that all the artists that we work with will receive a fair financial return from every item that we sell. So, by buying from us you can be sure that you are directly supporting the artists whose work you choose. We are incredibly proud to be working with so many talented people and that number continues to grow as more and more artists are realising that by letting us take the strain of producing and promoting their cards and prints it allows them more time to do what they do so well. From small beginnings with a few cards for sale in a couple of local galleries, we now supply tens of thousands of cards and hundreds of prints each year to retailers throughout the UK and also in Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, France, Germany, Canada, USA, Japan and Australia. We are always looking to supply more retailers, so if you are looking for beautiful, quality cards and prints that your customers will love, please have a look at what we offer."

Nostara Ltd,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/nostara-ltd,www.nostara.com,"Yeovil, United Kingdom","NOSTARA Delectable home fragrances made from natural ingredients The story of Nostara luxury home fragrance begins in 2017 in the heart of Somerset. With a previous career in teaching, Nikki Holt had enjoyed many happy years as a stay-at-home mum. The name, Nostara, was derived from Ostara, the Goddess of Spring, symbolising new beginnings: the perfect metaphor for the new venture. Nikki's goal was to create a range of natural soy wax candles and soy-based reed diffusers that look beautiful and smell amazing – the sort of products she wanted to buy for her own home. To this end, all of their essential oils are ethically and sustainably sourced, and with candles hand poured in the South West, the brand has a strong focus on local sourcing. Being fragrance-led with ethical sourcing is a top priority. There’s no doubt that Nostara was entering a crowded market, with candle sales currently rising faster than any other section of the British fragrance market. The challenges posed by selling fragrance online, particularly for an unknown startup, were not lost on them either. Their response has been to engage personally with their customers, with Nikki spending most of last year at top country and lifestyle events introducing the brand. It was an exhausting schedule but the customer-centric approach has proved highly successful: the brand has made genuine connections with customers, who, in turn, have welcomed the opportunity to meet such a passionate and proud business founder. The fledgling brand celebrated its second birthday last year with a launch party for its fabulous new fragrance, Leather & Vetiver. Nikki says, ‘Customers often asked us when we were going to do a more “manly” fragrance. Suggestions included coffee, gunpowder, beer and even petrol! We felt that many of our existing fragrances already had a diverse appeal but we took up the challenge and worked with our perfumer to design Leather & Vetiver, which has rich, dark undertones.’ Leather & Vetiver joined six other Nostara fragrances, ranging from Lime & Juniper and Bergamot & Black Tea to Ebony Rose & Burnished Amber. Nikki is currently developing new fragrances and formats to add to the carefully curated collection. Even as a young and growing brand, giving back has been very important. From its inception, the company has supported the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and is proud to have donated thousands to this cause. It has also contributed to many more charities by working closely with the Charity Fairs Association, which donated around £1.5 m in 2019. Nikki is optimistic about the growth of the brand – both in terms of her ability to create new lines that are timeless but still of the moment, and in her focus on building their digital presence on all social platforms to drive public awareness of their highly desirable collection."

Based in Newcastle, the North East of England, 'Samantha Lois Illustrations' was created in 2017 by Sam. She completed the final year of her degree in Fashion Design in 2017 but post graduation found herself more drawn towards abstract illustration and colour combinations; this led to a great hobby in sketching and drawing. As curiosity and techniques progressed Sam found herself making large scale abstract paintings and canvases using lots of texture and colour which became very popular. She finally found herself wanting to create art that incorporated a utilitarian design that could be used, appreciated and enjoyed by all. This is where abstract art through the medium of epoxy resin bonded onto serving boards began. As business has grown, so has the size of the serving boards which can now measure up to 50cm in length! The quality of product is of upmost importance, therefore only the highest quality food grade Epoxy Resin is used (FDA approved), along with a sustainably sourced and beautifully grained solid Olive Wood. Every board that is made is hand poured and finished to a very high standard and is totally unique to the next, making each piece one-of-a-kind and totally personal to you."

Steepletone’s UK Head Office is located in the village of Croughton on the South Northamptonshire/North Oxfordshire border, only 4 miles from the M40 Motorway and just South of the Silverstone Racing Circuit.

In the 1980’s Steepletone moved its manufacturing to the Far East to remain competitive in the market place. An office was formed in the region, which plays a significant role in maintaining product development, design, packaging, production and, of course, the very important role of Quality Control to ensure a high level of out-of-box reliability.   The Far East Team is headed up by Patrick Chan. The team have responsibility for quality, production and ensuring that all the products conform to the many European Standards which apply to products.

Swole Panda,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/swole-panda,www.swolepanda.com,"London, United Kingdom","Combining style with sustainability Ethically-minded brothers launch sustainable British clothing and accessories brand Two brothers have launched a range of sustainable clothing and accessories, all hand-crafted from sustainably sourced bamboo after learning about its significant benefits, whilst studying at university. With an increasing global awareness for sustainability and passion for quality, 26-year-old Oliver and 23 year-old James Slacke set-up Swole Panda after identifying a gap in the market for a British high-end clothing and accessories brand that combines style with sustainability. Oliver says, “Whilst I was studying Geography at university, learning about sustainable development and the impact humans are having on the natural environment, it led me to explore alternative resources, which can help to minimise this impact, without drastically changing our everyday lives. I came across bamboo and with its signficiant benefits, both environmentally and as a fabric use, it made complete sense to use this brilliant resource for our clothing and accessories range”. After leaving university, Oliver and James formalised the business together and started picking and packing product from Oliver’s bedroom. From designing and producing their first pair of bamboo sunglasses, Swole Panda has now grown onto encompass a range of sunglasses, socks, watches and scarves, all hand-crafted from sustainably sourced Moso Bamboo; a highly sustainable plant and one of the fastest growing natural resources. As well as having a positive impact on the environment, the use of bamboo has numerous benefits across the Swole Panda range, including a super-soft feel for their scarves that rivals cashmere, super lightweight feel for the sunglasses and anti-bacterial and moisture wicking properties for the sock collection. James says, “We’re so pleased with how Swole Panda has progressed in just a few years. We started the business with just one pair of bamboo sunglasses and now have a full range of clothing and accessories made from one of the most sustainable natural resources the planet has provided us with. Sustainable fashion is a big talking point right now and we’re proud to be part of this trend in terms of helping to pioneer a more sustainable future”."

We are thrilled that we continue to make products that stand the test of time from the quirky MR Perfect & Friends collection to our ‘Something for everyone’ All Year Round Gifting. The ever popular Naturally European range has retained a classic look but remains relevant by evolving aspects of the packaging and new fragrances. Similarly, with a long-established customer base the extremely affordable AAA range is seeing a renaissance with a new, younger audience who find the traditional floral design on-trend. In the last year the news has been full of stories about the poor environmental state of our planet. We have been horrified, like many, to understand the severity of the level of plastic in our oceans and landfill and the fact that only a small percentage gets recycled. We had already been looking at our sustainability program, but all the recent focus has us quickening our pace to becoming an environmentally sound company. During our research, we have come across many technological advances, which means that in the next few years innovation will see us using a variety of materials that are only just being developed. So, what are we doing for the time being, while these advances are taking place?We have done a lot of research into material types that are currently available and how best to use them. We have educated ourselves by attending sustainability conferences and recycling programmes to ensure the decisions we make now, are the best in terms of protecting our planet. At this point in time, we give you our word that each time we create a new product we will ensure they are as environmentally-friendly as possible, during this period of change. Please do bear with us as we develop products a year to eighteen months in advance, so the exciting changes we are making will take a little while to filter through. A big ‘Thank You’ to our returning customers, you are at the heart of what we do. To our new customers, we would be thrilled if you devoted some of your precious shelf space to The Somerset Toiletry Company.

Vintage Child,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/vintage-child,vintagechild.co.uk,"Crowborough, United Kingdom","I design and produce a range of leather bags with a focus on functionality and affordability. I really enjoy designing and it’s my favourite part of what I do, I often design for myself or people I know and what they would want to wear and I find that those bags always sell the best because I’ve really put a piece of myself into the design. I could draw for hours and love spending time picking the perfect leather for a specific style then working on samples and finally bringing the finished pieces to my customers, it’s a long process and I really put my heart and soul into my designs. I aim to make my bags classic and timeless, just like vintage clothing. I studied fashion and textiles at CSM in London, this gave me an excellent start for opening my business as I have a wide knowledge of different materials and how to work with them and also developed my eye for detail. I started selling vintage clothing and accessories in 2011 and quickly found a love for vintage leather bags, so I began designing my own bags inspired by designs I came across over the years. I now design and produce a range of leather bags focusing on timeless design, functionality and travel with a classic vintage style which helps me remember where I started. Sustainability has been of personal importance to me for many years and is now a huge part of my business, how I design, the factories I work with and my leather choices. Most recently I have been designing a range of bags created from leather wastage. Every year thousands of tonnes of leather end up on the cutting room floor so in an effort to promote a more sustainable alternative last year I started developing products made from leather off-cuts which would otherwise be thrown away. After market testing I found it was a popular concept and had feedback evidence that customers liked the idea of a more sustainable product. So I am now developing a sustainable range made entirely from leather off-cuts which I will be exhibiting at Home and Gift for the first time ever. Furthering my efforts to grow in a sustainable and responsible way, last year I made my business carbon neutral by donating to worthy conservation charities like the Sumatran Orang-utan Society, Surfers Against Sewage and Friends of the Earth and I am a member of the Sussex Wildlife Trust who fulfil essential conservation work in Sussex (where I am based). Being able to support charities and push for a more sustainable and ethical future in fashion is something I feel very lucky to be able to do. I have a close working relationship with my supplier who I know personally and speak to on a daily basis. This has enabled me to really focus on building a conscientious business, ensuring the factories I use are ethical and eco aware and I work openly with the workshop to ensure the environment is a fair, healthy and happy one, challenging my suppliers to report any ethical issues they identify."

We Love Seasons Ltd,https://homeandgift.co.uk/exhibitor/we-love-seasons-ltd,www.weloveseasons.com,United Kingdom,"We Love Seasons is a business selling a range of seasonal decorations and gifts with a focus on contemporary products for Easter, Christmas and Halloween. The company launched in August 2018 and the range will be expanded at Harrogate to include Valentines. Each season has its own sub-brand; Magical Easter, The Haunted Halloween, The Christmas Villa and We Love Valentines. The Founders Inspiration for We Love Seasons My earliest memories of growing up in Denmark are of my mother getting our home ready for Christmas. Towards the end of November she would begin to gather the most amazing decorations; homemade hearts made out of red felt would adorn the entrance to the living room, garlands made out of fresh pine would hang from the dining room doors, hand-painted figurines would sit on the windowsills, all under the watchful eye of Santa and his helpers, made out of stones with knitted scarves and hats. The main feature of course was the Christmas tree, decorated by my Dad with red baubles, lights, drums, Danish flags and glistening with fine gold lametta. At Easter, the table would be beautifully laid with yellow napkins and the fluffiest chicks. My mother would fill a vase with branches from the garden, nestled with hand-painted papier-mâché eggs. With our hand-picked seasonal collections, I have tried to capture the essence of what my family created at these special times of year. I hope you will find the We Love Seasons collections as magical as we do."
